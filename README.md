## Technical Details

Threagile Plus is built upon JGraph (also known as [mxGraph](https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph)) and [Threagile](https://github.com/Threagile/threagile), which was compiled to WebAssembly (WASM). The combination of these technologies allows for an enhanced and intuitive experience with threat modeling.
