I know, super n00by, but right now this is a one man show
TODO:
Tests:
- Add more tests with all of these menus
    - Asset
        - Dont focus on the CIA, we will remove that, we should probably do that now, 
        just make it non changable and get the values from the data assets
    - Vertices
    - TrustBoundary
- User movements
    - Add a test where you create a node
    - Add a test where you delete a node
    - Add a test where you undo ctrl z
    - Add a test where you copy a node
    - Add a test where you paste a node
    - Add a test where trag a node from a trust boundary back and forth


Features
- I feel like the components shold look better, but we gonna do this at the end
- I feel like data assets menu looks horrendous, but we will fix that later
