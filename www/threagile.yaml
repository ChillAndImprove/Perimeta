# NOTE:
#
# For a perfect editing experience within your IDE of choice you can easily
# get model syntax validation and autocompletion (very handy for enum values)
# as well as live templates: Just import the schema.json into your IDE and assign
# it as "schema" to each Threagile YAML file. Also try to import individual parts
# from the live-templates.txt file into your IDE as live editing templates.
#
# You might also want to try the REST API when running in server mode...
