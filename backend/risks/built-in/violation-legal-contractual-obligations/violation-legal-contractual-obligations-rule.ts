    description: "Insufficient security of information, business processes, or IT systems (e.g., due to inadequate security management, lack of awareness of obligations, or failure to implement necessary controls) can lead to violations of applicable legal requirements (e.g., data protection laws, industry-specific regulations) or contractually agreed security standards with business partners. This risk is heightened by insufficient knowledge of diverse national and international laws, such as those related to data protection, information disclosure, insolvency, liability, or third-party information access.",
    impact: "Violations can result in severe legal consequences (e.g., fines, sanctions, lawsuits), contractual penalties (e.g., damages, termination of contracts, loss of business relationships), loss of certifications or licenses, significant reputational damage, and erosion of trust from customers and partners.",
    asvs: "Derived from BSI IT-Grundschutz ISM.2.7 VerstoÃŸ gegen gesetzliche Regelungen und vertragliche Vereinbarungen.",
    cheatSheet: "https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ITGrundschutz/itgrundschutz_node.html (General BSI IT-Grundschutz - Search for ISM.2.7)",
    action: "Identify, Understand, Implement, and Continuously Monitor Compliance with All Applicable Legal and Contractual Security Obligations.",
    mitigation: "Top management must ensure that: " +
        "1. A comprehensive process is established and maintained to identify all relevant legal (national, international), regulatory, and contractual security obligations applicable to the institution's information, processes, and IT systems. " +
        "2. These obligations are thoroughly understood, documented, and effectively communicated to all relevant personnel and stakeholders. " +
        "3. Appropriate technical and organizational security measures (TOMs) are designed, implemented, maintained, and regularly verified to meet these obligations. This typically involves a robust Information Security Management System (ISMS). " +
        "4. Compliance requirements are integrated into the entire lifecycle (design, development, operation, decommissioning) of IT systems and business processes. " +
        "5. For institutions with international operations or handling international data, specific expertise and adherence to relevant foreign laws (e.g., regarding data protection, disclosure obligations, liability, information access for third parties) are ensured. " +
        "6. Contracts with business partners, suppliers, and service providers are carefully reviewed for security requirements, and mechanisms for ensuring and monitoring compliance are established. " +
        "7. Regular internal and external compliance audits, risk assessments, and reviews are conducted, specifically focusing on legal and contractual adherence, and any identified gaps are remediated promptly.",
    check: "Is the institution fully aware of all its legal, regulatory, and contractual security obligations relevant to its IT systems, information, and business processes? Are there adequate, implemented, and regularly verified security measures and robust governance processes in place to ensure ongoing compliance and prevent violations?",
    function: RiskFunction.Governance, // This risk primarily relates to governance failures in ensuring compliance.
    stride: STRIDE.Repudiation, // Failure to implement required security measures can be seen as repudiating the (implicit or explicit) obligation to comply with laws and contracts.
    detectionLogic: "Applies to technical assets that, due to their nature (e.g., processing sensitive data like PII or financial data; supporting critical business operations; being subject to specific SLAs or regulatory oversight), are likely targets for significant legal or contractual security obligations. The risk materializes if the overall security posture or specific controls for these assets are deemed insufficient to meet such obligations. This insufficiency can stem from inadequate security management, lack of awareness of legal/contractual requirements, or failure to implement and maintain necessary controls.",
    riskAssessment: "The likelihood of violating legal or contractual obligations is rated 'Possible' to 'Likely' if security management practices are generally weak, if there's a lack of awareness of specific obligations, or if compliance measures for critical assets are not evident or robust. The impact is typically 'High' to 'Very High' depending on the criticality of the asset/data involved and the severity of potential consequences (e.g., substantial fines for data protection breaches like GDPR, loss of major contracts, severe reputational damage, or even operational shutdown).",
    falsePositives: "A false positive might occur if, for a specific flagged asset, robust and independently verified compliance measures are indeed in place that fully address all pertinent legal and contractual security obligations. This can happen if these measures are managed outside the scope of the threat model or are not detailed in a way that Threagile can automatically recognize their sufficiency.",
