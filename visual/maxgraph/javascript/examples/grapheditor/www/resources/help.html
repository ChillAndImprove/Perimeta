    <h2>Hello, dear user!</h2>
    <p>
        I, your humble <strong>solo developer</strong>, would love to have penned a glorious, detail-rich, and mesmerizing help text to guide you through the intricacies of this software, leaving no stone unturned.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, I find myself caught in a vortex of code, a deluge of debugging, and a downright tsunami of tasks that are demanding my attention. It seems there's no escape from this whirlwind of ones and zeros - I'm the sole sailor navigating this digital sea!
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine a juggling act, but with a <em>billion balls</em> in the air (okay, slight exaggeration) and the juggler is on a unicycle, on a tightrope... you get the picture!
    </p>
    <p>
        So, I'd ask you, brave adventurer, to treat this software like an archaeological expedition - full of excitement, discovery, and the occasional ancient bug (don't worry, no actual insects involved!). 
    </p>
    <p>
        While my hands are tied up wrestling with a nest of naughty code, I encourage you to explore the features, click the buttons, and embark on a journey of self-guided discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>P.S.</strong> I promise, just as soon as I have tamed this wild beast of coding chaos, I'll put on my writer's hat and craft a magnificent help text that will illuminate the darkest corners of your software-related questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Until then, happy exploring!
